# Pizza Best Practices

This is a living document I use to gather my findings at making neapolitan-style pizza.

Most, if not all, the recommendations in this document have been tested by manipulating the single 
variable mentioned while keeping the rest unaltered.

## Dough

### Hydration

  - Aim for 60% to 70% hydration.

  *Why?*: low hydration dough achieves less oven spring.

  *Why?*: low hydration dough hardens and chars faster during cooking.

  *Why?*: high hydration dough is harder to work with.

  *Why?*: high hydration dough overproofs more easily.

### Folding

  - Fold the dough 4-6 times while it is rising.

  *Why?*: folding helps build dough elasticity/strength.

### Storing in the fridge

  - Cover dough balls with cellophane wrap when storing them in the fridge.

  *Why?*: dough exposed to dry air in the fridge will unevenly lose moisture, and thus elasticity.

## Shaping

### Resting

  - Stretch and fold the dough into a ball and leave it to rest before shaping.

  *Why?*: stored dough builds up more moisture on the bottom than on the top, making it more sticky.

  *Why?*: dough structure becomes less homogenous while fermenting, making it easier to tear when shaping.

### Dough Temperature

  - Shape dough at room temperature.

  *Why?*: cold dough is less elastic and rips more easily.

  *Why?*: warm dough is more elastic and less forgiving of over-stretching.

  *Why?*: warm dough can ferment further on the counter.

## Toppings

### Weight

  - Keep total topping weight low.

  *Why?*: heavy toppings will take longer to cook.

  *Why?*: heavy toppings will weight down the tip of the slice, making it droop down.

  *Why?*: heavy toppings can prevent enough the dough from cooking through.

## Cooking

### Dough Temperature

  - Cook dough that is at room temperature.

  *Why?*: cold dough achieves less oven spring.

  *Why?*: cold dough chars base more easily.

### Dusting flour

  - Use the least amount of dusting flour possible.

  *Why?*: Carbonized flour beneath the pizza gives it a bad taste.

  *Why?*: Reducing heat transfer to pizza base reduces possible oven spring.

## Tmpl

### Tmpl

  - Do thing.

  *Why?*: reason

  ```
  /* avoid */
  ```
